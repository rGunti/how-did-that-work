# Create a website

If you want to build a website like this one, have a look at the underlying [GitHub repository][git].

This page is built using [VuePress][vuepress], a static webpage generator and hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghp].
The [repository][git] also contains a [GitHub Action][gha] [file][workflow] that automatically builds and deploys this website.
